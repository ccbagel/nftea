# Development process

Initially, creating a web3 app looked too complicated for me to add to my portfolio. As a developer, I wanted to challenge myself into building something I wasn't familiar with. So I dived right in and did my best. I had no experience in building web3 applications and I still don't understand a lot of it. Therefore, I gathered all of the documentation on the tools I needed and got started. Here's how the process went: 
- Breaking the app into separate tasks, issues, features, and using a Kanban board to visualize the process. 
- Writing a spec doc and most importantly hand writing notes about how I would put pieces of logic together. I did a lot of planning before writing any code. This shortened the time I spent developing the app.
- Anticipating bugs and embaracing them. I used bugs as a guiding point. I used to hate bugs, now I use them to my advantage to guide me through solutions to complete a task. I also use bugs to test my code better. Since I know where the weak points are in the code and what is most likely to break, I could test more components/logic that would've been overlooked.
- Creating strict constraints for code reusability. I created pure components that I could use anywhere as well as custom hooks to avoid rewriting logic
- Testing critical logic and custom hooks
- Using user stories to avoid over-engineering the app
- Following a design I found to turn design into functional code
- Clean code and following best practices i.e YAGNI, DRY, etc...
- Separating my Git workflow from my master branch


# Technical details

## Frontend
- I used NextJS for the frontend mainly for two reasons. NextJS's image and performance optimizations. Since my app is image heavy, I decided to use NextJS. I also wanted to test out Incremental statitc regeneration for higher cache hit rates and see how the loading speed does. Finally, I had a few pages in mind that I wanted to statically pre-render, server-side render, and client-side render (via SWR).
- I also used Tailwind to style my app. 

## API
- I used SWR to fetch my data for it's data caching and revalidating benefits. I then used the `map` method and destructured JSON to shape my data for my components to consume. 

## Backend
- As a frontend developer who can also work in the backend, I made the mistake of building a fullstack app on my first attempt. I ended up spending more time working on my server code, APIs, and trying different data encryption libs for my database models/schemas instead of working on the frontend. I ripped out the backend and replaced it with Firebase 9. Along the way I came across Moralis, a web3 SDK for the web. I thought it would be interesting to build a web3 app even though I didn't know what it really was. So I decided to go with Moralis and thats how this app came about.

## Testing
- I used React Testing Library to test my custom hooks. 
- I also used MSW (MockServiceWorker) instead of mocking Axios and Fetch network requests to test the app better from a user's perspective

## Issues



# Final thoughts
- I'm glad I built this app because it pushed me to learn how to use bugs as guiding points instead of becoming frustrated. I now enjoy finding bugs and depend on them to get a feature done or issue closed. This is something that can't be taught and I'm glad I developed this trait which I maybe would've never did without this project.
- Something I should have implemented is state management and more testing if I had more time. 
- I also wanted to implement pagination and searching for NFTs on the dashboard page. I ran into some issues because since the page is pre-rendered on the server, I had no way to access the `window` object or any client-side state. Therefore, I would have to use client-side rendering. This being my first Nextjs app, this was the only solution I could find. I decided to stick to server-rendering because I wanted to try it out and practice it. 
- I really enjoyed this app and I'm thinking of trying out Turborepo to build a monorepo (since I'm already using NextJS & Vercel). The purpose of this is to have a web app and a hybrid mobile app for iOS & Android using React Native. I want to mint NFTs and create a spin off project that would allow photographers to turn their catalogue into digital assets and also for the ownership benefits. The app would also allow users to take photos and mint them into NFTs. 

I also included a documentation page in my project you can take a look at.
